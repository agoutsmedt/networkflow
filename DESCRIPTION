Description: This package proposes a series of function to make it easier
    and quicker to work on networks. It mainly targets working on
    bibliometric networks (see the
    [biblionetwork](https://github.com/agoutsmedt/biblionetwork) package
    for creating such networks). This package heavily relies on
    [igraph](https://igraph.org/r/) and
    [tidygraph](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/index.html), and aims
    at producing ready-made networks for projecting them using
    [ggraph](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/). This package does not
    invent nothing new, properly speaking, but it allows the users to
    follow more quickly and easily the main steps of network manipulation,
    from creating the graph to projecting it. It is inspired by what could
    be done with [GEPHI](https://gephi.org/): the package allows the use
    of the Leiden community detection algorithm, as well as of the Force
    Atlas 2 layout, both being unavailable in igraph (and so in
    tidygraph).
