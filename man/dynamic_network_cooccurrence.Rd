\usage{
dynamic_network_cooccurrence(
  nodes = NULL,
  directed_edges = NULL,
  source_column = NULL,
  target_column = NULL,
  time_variable = NULL,
  time_window = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{nodes}{The table with all the nodes and their metadata. For instance, if your nodes are
articles, this table is likely to contain the year of publication, the name of the authors,
the title of the article, etc... The table must have one row per node.}

\item{directed_edges}{The table with of all the elements to which your nodes are connected. If your nodes are
articles, the \code{directed_edges} table can contain the list of the references cited
by these articles, the authors that have written these articles, or the affiliations
of the authors of these articles.}

\item{source_column}{The column with the unique identifier of each node. For instance, for a bibliographic
coupling network, the id of your citing documents.}

\item{target_column}{The column with the unique identifier of each element connected to the node (for
instance, the identifier of the reference cited by your node if the node is an article).}

\item{time_variable}{The column with the temporal variable you want to use to build your windows for the
succession of networks. By default, \code{time_variable} is \code{NULL} and the function
will only build one network without taking into account any temporal variable.}

\item{time_window}{The length of your network relatively of the unity of the \code{time_variable} column. If you
use a variable in years as \code{time_variable} and you set \code{time_window} at 5, the function
will build network on five year windows. By default, \code{time_window} is \code{NULL} and the
function will only build one network.}

\item{cooccurrence_method}{Choose a cooccurrence method to build your indirect edges table. The function propose
three methods that depends on the \href{https://agoutsmedt.github.io/biblionetwork/}{biblionetwork package}
and three methods that are implemented in it:
\itemize{
\item the coupling angle measure (see \code{\link[biblionetwork:biblio_coupling]{biblionetwork::biblio_coupling()}} for documentation);
\item the coupling strength measure (\code{\link[biblionetwork:coupling_strength]{biblionetwork::coupling_strength()}});
\item the coupling similarity measure (\code{\link[biblionetwork:coupling_similarity]{biblionetwork:: coupling_similarity()}}).
}}

\item{overlapping_window}{Set to \code{FALSE} by default. If set to \code{TRUE}, and if \code{time_variable} and \code{time_window} not
\code{NULL}, the function will create a succession of networks for moving time windows. The windows are
moving one unit per one unit of the \code{time_variable}. For instance, for years, if \code{time_window}
set to 5, it creates networks for successive time windows like 1970-1974, 1971-1975, 1972-1976, etc.}

\item{edges_threshold}{Threshold value for building your edges. With a higher threshold, only the stronger links
will be kept. See the \href{https://agoutsmedt.github.io/biblionetwork/}{biblionetwork package}
documentation and the \code{cooccurrence_method} parameter.}

\item{compute_size}{Set to \code{FALSE} by default. If \code{TRUE}, the function uses the \code{directed_edges} data
to calculate how many directed edges a node receives (as a target). If \code{directed_edges}
is a table of direct citations, the functions calculates the number of time a node
is cited by the other nodes. You need to have the \code{target_column} in the \code{nodes} table
to make the link with the targetted nodes in the \code{directed_edges} table.}

\item{keep_singleton}{Set to \code{FALSE} by default. If \code{TRUE}, the function removes the nodes that have no
undirected edges, i.e. no cooccurrence with any other nodes. In graphical terms,
these nodes are alone in the network, with no link with other nodes.}

\item{verbose}{Set to \code{FALSE} if you don't want the function to display different sort of information.}
}
\value{
If \code{time_window} is \code{NULL}, the function computes only
one network and return a tidygraph object built with \link[tidygraph:tbl_graph]{tbl_graph()}.
If \code{time_variable} and \code{time_window} are not \code{NULL}, the function returns a list
of tidygraph networks, for each time window.

This function was implemented in an earlier version of the development of this package.
It has been replaced by \code{networkflow::build_dynamic_networks()}.
This function creates one or several tidygraph networks from a table of nodes and its
directed edges. For instance, for bibliometric networks, you can give a list of
articles and the list of the references these articles cite. You can use it to
build a single network or multiple networks over different time windows.
